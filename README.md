# Analyzing the Covid-19 Positive Cases and Deaths Corresponding to Various Parameters of The World Happiness Report

This project analyzes the spread of Covid-19 and deaths caused by the pandemic in various countries corresponding to parameters as published by The World Happiness Report. Assuming that countries with a higher happiness index are more developed, our visulaizations result that the spread and deaths of Covid-19 in developed countries is more as opposed to underdeveloped countries. As developed and underdeveloped countries have an evident disparity between each of their medical advancement, it is safe to conclude that underdeveloped countries do not have the testing kits required to record the Covid-19 victims and deaths in their country.

The Covid-19 datasets used are taken by John Hopkins University and the World Happiness report by the United Nations - published anually, can be found in the dataset folder.

This project uses matplotlib python library to make meanigful visualization in tandem with pandas, numpy and seaborn.

Visualization and analysis of both Covid-19 cases in each country and deaths are in indivdual Jupyter notebooks and can be accessed as needed.
